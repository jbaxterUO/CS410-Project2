# CS410-Project2

- I implemented an indicator above the player's head as a sort of guidance system on what direction the exit is. The implementation uses a dot product to determine how close to the right direction the player is facing in regards to the exit.

- As a part of the indicator implementation I also implemented a color transition using a Lerp.

- Finally I added particles that display from the ghost on a routine and some other small visual things.
